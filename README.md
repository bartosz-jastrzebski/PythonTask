Recruitment task


Task description:
Assuming that you have a date in the "A/B/C" format, where A,B,C are integers
between 0 and 2999, we want you to output the earliest possible legal date between
Jan 1, 2000 and Dec 31, 2999 (inclusive) using them as day, month and year (but not
necessarily in that order).
Input:
● The input file consists of a single line containing three integers separated by "/".
● There are no extra spaces around the "/".
● Years may be truncated to two digits and may in that case also omit the leading 0 (if
there is one), so 2000 could be given as "2000", "00" or "0" (but not as an empty
string).
● Months and days may be zero-padded.
● You may assume that the year, when given with four digits, is between 2000 and
2999.
● At most one of the integers has four digits, and the others have one or two digits.
Output:
● Output a single line giving the earliest legal date possible given the above
constraints.
● The output should be formatted as year-month-day, where year has four digits, and
month and day have two digits each (zero padding), for example "2011-07-15".
● If there is no legal date (subject to the above constraints) then output a single line
with the original string followed by the words "is illegal".
Recall that a year is a leap year (has 366 days) if the year is divisible by 4, unless it is
divisible also by 100 but not by 400 (so 2000 is a leap year, 2100 is not a leap year, and
2012 is a leap year).

Please use only standard python libraries, I expect it to run like this:
python date.py input.txt
you can use python 2/3
Example:
1/2/3 => 2001-2-3
3/20/1 => 2001-3-20
